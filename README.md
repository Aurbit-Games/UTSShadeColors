UTSShadeColors is a Unity script that automatically generates toon shading colors based on a base color, applying color shifts to create a first and second shade. You can easily adjust the hue, saturation, and value differences for custom shading effects. This script is useful for achieving dynamic and automated toon shading effects in your materials.

# How to Use:
1. Attach this script to a GameObject with a MeshRenderer with a Unity Toon material.
2. Adjust the `Base Color` to set the initial color.
3. Tweak the `Hue Shift`, `Saturation Diff`, and `Value Diff` properties to customize the shading effect.
4. Press "Set Colors" in the Inspector or enable `Show Preview` to automatically update the colors when changes are made (Editor only).
5. The first and second shade colors are calculated based on the base color and hue shift.
